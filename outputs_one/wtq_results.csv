From the summary:
- The table contains various categories of losses during World War II in Poland, with specific losses recorded for each year from 1939/40 to 1944/45.
- Each row represents a different description of casualties.

From the full table:
- The relevant columns for 1939/40 are:
  - Direct War Losses: 360000.0
  - Murdered: 75000.0
  - Deaths In Prisons & Camps: 69000.0
  - Deaths Outside of Prisons & Camps: nan (not applicable for this year)
  - Murdered in Eastern Regions: nan (not applicable for this year)
  - Deaths other countries: nan (not applicable for this year)
  - Total: 504000.0

To calculate the total number of deaths in 1939/40, I can summarize the relevant values that are not ""nan"":
1. Direct War Losses: 360000.0
2. Murdered: 75000.0
3. Deaths In Prisons & Camps: 69000.0

Now, I will sum these values:
- Total deaths in 1939/40 = 360000.0 (Direct War Losses) + 75000.0 (Murdered) + 69000.0 (Deaths In Prisons & Camps)  
= 360000 + 75000 + 69000 = 504000.0

Since the ""Total"" column for 1939/40 also confirms this value as 504000.0, we can be assured that our calculation is consistent with the data.

From the summary:
- The table captures various categories of losses, including direct war losses, murders, deaths in prisons and camps, and other categories.
- We need to focus on the column for the year 1940/41 to obtain the relevant figures.

From the full table:
- For the year 1940/41, the values in the relevant rows are as follows:
  - Direct War Losses: nan (not available)
  - Murdered: 100000.0
  - Deaths In Prisons & Camps: 210000.0
  - Deaths Outside of Prisons & Camps: 42000.0
  - Murdered in Eastern Regions: nan (not available)
  - Deaths other countries: nan (not available)

Next, we will add the values from the categories that are relevant for the total number of ethnic Polish deaths during 1940/41:
- Murdered: 100000.0
- Deaths In Prisons & Camps: 210000.0
- Deaths Outside of Prisons & Camps: 42000.0

Now, summing these values:
\( 100000.0 + 210000.0 + 42000.0 = 352000.0 \)

Thus, by combining the evidence from both the summary (focusing on the year 1940/41) and the specific figures from the full table, we conclude that the total number of ethnic Polish deaths recorded during 1940/41 is 352000.

nu-1578,in what years were the total deaths more than in 1940/41 but less than in 1939/40?,1941/42,1941/42,select * from T,"First, we need to compare the total deaths in each year to determine which years had more deaths than in 1940/41 but less than in 1939/40.

From the full table:
- Total deaths in each year are as follows:
  - 1939/40: 504000
  - 1940/41: 352000
  - 1941/42: 407000
  - 1942/43: 541000
  - 1943/44: 681000
  - 1944/45: 270000

Based on the information provided, we can see that the total deaths in 1941/42 (407000) were more than in 1940/41 (352000) but less than in 1939/40 (504000).

Therefore, the years when the total deaths were more than in 1940/41 but less than in 1939/40 are 1941/42.

From the summary:
- We need to focus on the total losses indicated in the relevant rows of the table, specifically excluding the direct war losses row (row 0).

From the full table, the relevant rows and their total losses are:
1. Murdered: 506000
2. Deaths In Prisons & Camps: 1146000
3. Deaths Outside of Prisons & Camps: 473000
4. Murdered in Eastern Regions: 100000
5. Deaths other countries: 2000
6. Total (this row includes all categories): 2770000 (but we are not using this as it includes direct war losses)

Now, adding the totals from the relevant categories:
- Murdered: 506000
- Deaths In Prisons & Camps: 1146000
- Deaths Outside of Prisons & Camps: 473000
- Murdered in Eastern Regions: 100000
- Deaths other countries: 2000

Calculating the total:
- 506000 + 1146000 + 473000 + 100000 + 2000 = 2112000

Thus, the total number of losses not including direct war losses is 2112000.

Generated Reasoning SQL: To determine the last date on the list, we need to consider the "Date" column, which is categorical and represents the specific date of the competition. Since the dates are in chronological order, we can find the last date by sorting the dates in descending order and selecting the top 1 result.

SQL: 
SELECT "Date" 
FROM T 
ORDER BY "Date" DESC 
LIMIT 1;
Generated Final SQL: SELECT "Date" FROM T ORDER BY "Date" DESC LIMIT 1;
SQL 실행 결과 셀 수: 1

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- If one cell is returned, use it directly.
- If multiple rows/columns, reason step by step over the SQL result to select, count, or summarize per the question.
- Never apologize; the SQL result always has the answer.
- Return values exactly as in the result, unless a transformation (count, difference, etc.) is explicitly asked.

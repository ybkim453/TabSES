Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To determine the number of years where there were no playoffs, we need to count the rows where the "Playoffs" column is equal to "No playoff". We should exclude any outlier rows that do not provide relevant data for this analysis.

SQL: 
SELECT COUNT("Year") 
FROM T 
WHERE "Playoffs" LIKE '%No playoff%';
Generated Final SQL: SELECT COUNT("Year") FROM T WHERE "Playoffs" LIKE '%No playoff%';
SQL 실행 결과 셀 수: 1

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- Always write a short reasoning step before the Final Answer.
- If one cell is returned: briefly confirm it is the only result.
- If multiple rows/columns: reason step by step to filter or choose.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

Examples:

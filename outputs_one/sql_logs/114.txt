Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To determine the competition in which Plawgo competed after the 1999 European Junior Championships, we need to filter rows where the "Year" is greater than 1999 and the "Athlete" is Marek Plawgo. We will then select the distinct values in the "Competition" column to identify the competitions he participated in after 1999.

SQL: 
SELECT DISTINCT "Competition" 
FROM T 
WHERE "Year" > 1999 AND "Athlete" = 'Marek Plawgo';
Generated Final SQL: SELECT DISTINCT "Competition" FROM T WHERE "Year" > 1999 AND "Athlete" = 'Marek Plawgo';

The provided summary is the primary structure for interpreting the Full Table.  
Always start by carefully examining the summary to identify which columns, data types, and special cases are relevant to the question.  
Then, use the full table to confirm and extract the exact values based on the hints from the summary.  
Your reasoning must explicitly combine evidence from both the summary and the full table before giving the final answer.  
Final output must follow the format:

How many cyclists in the top 10 were French?
To answer this question, I will use both the summary and the full table.

From the summary:
- The **Cyclist** column is text and includes both name and nationality in parentheses, e.g., "Stéphane Goubert (FRA)".
- Special / Atypical Rows: none were listed, so every row in the preview represents an individual cyclist.
- Preprocessing Artifacts: none critical except "s.t." in the Time column, which stands for "same time". This does not affect nationality counting.

From the full table:
- The cyclists with "(FRA)" are:
  1. Stéphane Goubert (Rank 8, FRA)
  2. David Moncoutié (Rank 10, FRA)

Thus, by combining the summary’s description (Cyclist column contains nationality; no atypical rows interfere)  
with the explicit entries in the full table, we can conclude there are 2 French cyclists in the top 10.

Final Answer: Stéphane Goubert, David Moncoutié

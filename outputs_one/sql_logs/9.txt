   - Data type: Categorical
   - 4 representative example values: Alexandr Kolobnev (RUS), Davide Rebellin (ITA), Franco Pellizotti (ITA), Samuel Sánchez (ESP)
   - Role: Descriptor

3. Team:
   - Data type: Categorical
   - 4 representative example values: Team CSC Saxo Bank, Gerolsteiner, Liquigas, Euskaltel-Euskadi
   - Role: Descriptor

4. Time:
   - Data type: Categorical
   - 4 representative example values: s.t., + 2"
   - Role: Measure

5. UCI ProTour Points:
   - Data type: Numeric
   - 4 representative example values: 30, 25, 15, 7
   - Role: Measure

**Outlier Row Analysis:**

1. Row 0:
   - The values in this row are not significantly different from the majority of the table. Therefore, this row is an ordinary row and does not require special handling.

2. Row 9:
   - The value "+ 2"" in the Time column is different from the majority of the table, which mostly has "s.t." This makes the row an outlier in terms of the Time column.

3. Row 1:
   - The values in this row are not significantly different from the majority of the table. Therefore, this row is an ordinary row and does not require special handling.

Generated Reasoning SQL: To find the cyclist ranked between Denis Menchov and Stephane Goubert, we need to identify the rank of these two cyclists and then select the cyclist with a rank between them.  
From the summary, we know that the "Rank" column is numeric and serves as an identifier.  
We first need to determine the ranks of Denis Menchov and Stephane Goubert, and then select the cyclist(s) with a rank between them.  
SQL:  
```
SELECT "Cyclist"
FROM T
WHERE "Rank" > (SELECT "Rank" FROM T WHERE "Cyclist" = 'Denis Menchov')
AND "Rank" < (SELECT "Rank" FROM T WHERE "Cyclist" = 'Stephane Goubert');
```
Generated Final SQL: ``` SELECT "Cyclist" FROM T WHERE "Rank" > (SELECT "Rank" FROM T WHERE "Cyclist" = 'Denis Menchov') AND "Rank" < (SELECT "Rank" FROM T WHERE "Cyclist" = 'Stephane Goubert'); ```

The provided summary is the primary structure for interpreting the Full Table.  
Always start by carefully examining the summary to identify which columns, data types, and special cases are relevant to the question.  
Then, use the full table to confirm and extract the exact values based on the hints from the summary.  
Your reasoning must explicitly combine evidence from both the summary and the full table before giving the final answer.  
Final output must follow the format:

How many cyclists in the top 10 were French?
To answer this question, I will use both the summary and the full table.

From the summary:
- The **Cyclist** column is text and includes both name and nationality in parentheses, e.g., "Stéphane Goubert (FRA)".
- Special / Atypical Rows: none were listed, so every row in the preview represents an individual cyclist.
- Preprocessing Artifacts: none critical except "s.t." in the Time column, which stands for "same time". This does not affect nationality counting.

From the full table:
- The cyclists with "(FRA)" are:
  1. Stéphane Goubert (Rank 8, FRA)
  2. David Moncoutié (Rank 10, FRA)

Thus, by combining the summary’s description (Cyclist column contains nationality; no atypical rows interfere)  
with the explicit entries in the full table, we can conclude there are 2 French cyclists in the top 10.

Final Answer: Stéphane Goubert, David Moncoutié

Question: who was ranked between denis menchov and stephane goubert?
A: To find the answer to this question, let’s think step by step.
[Fallback] Raw Response: To determine who was ranked between Denis Menchov and Stéphane Goubert, we need to look at the Rank column in the full table.

Denis Menchov is at Rank 6 and Stéphane Goubert is at Rank 8, so we are looking for the cyclist at Rank 7.

From the table, we see that Samuel Sánchez (ESP) from Euskaltel-Euskadi was ranked at position 7.

Therefore, the cyclist ranked between Denis Menchov and Stéphane Goubert was Samuel Sánchez.

Final Answer: Samuel Sánchez

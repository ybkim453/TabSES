Generated Reasoning SQL: The summary indicates that the columns for the years (1939/40, 1940/41, etc.) are numeric and represent the number of losses for each year. To answer the question about the total deaths that happened in 1939/1940, we need to sum the values in the "1939/40" column. We must also exclude any outlier rows, specifically the "Total" row, as it does not represent a specific year's data. The relevant column for our calculation is "1939/40", and we will sum the values while ensuring to cast them as INTEGER to avoid any issues with data types.
SQL: SELECT SUM(CAST("1939/40" AS INTEGER)) AS total_deaths_1939_40 FROM T WHERE "Description Losses" != 'Total';
Generated Final SQL: SELECT SUM(CAST("1939/40" AS INTEGER)) AS total_deaths_1939_40 FROM T WHERE "Description Losses" != 'Total';

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- If one cell is returned, use it directly.
- If multiple rows/columns, reason step by step over the SQL result to select, count, or summarize per the question.
- Never apologize; the SQL result always has the answer.
- Return values exactly as in the result, unless a transformation (count, difference, etc.) is explicitly asked.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

Examples:

Table_title: Olympic Events
SQL: select "event" from T where cast("year" as integer) = 2008

event
100m Sprint

Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To find the only years where total losses were below 350,000, we need to consider the "Total" column, which represents the total losses for each year. We should exclude the outlier row 6 (Total) as it is an aggregate row. We will filter the rows based on the "Total" column being less than 350,000 and retrieve the corresponding years.

SQL:
SELECT "row_number", "Total"
FROM T
WHERE "Total" < 350000;
Generated Final SQL: SELECT "row_number", "Total" FROM T WHERE "Total" < 350000;

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- If one cell is returned, use it directly.
- If multiple rows/columns, reason step by step over the SQL result to select, count, or summarize per the question.
- Never apologize; the SQL result always has the answer.
- Return values exactly as in the result, unless a transformation (count, difference, etc.) is explicitly asked.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

Examples:

Table_title: Olympic Events
SQL: select "event" from T where cast("year" as integer) = 2008

event
100m Sprint
Long Jump
Marathon
Swimming

Question: how many events were held in 2008?
Answer: Let's think step by step.  
There are 4 rows returned for 2008, each representing one event.  
Final Answer: 4


Table_title: 2013-14 Toros Mexico season
SQL: select "opponent", "date" from T where "date" > '2014-11-10' order by "date" asc

opponent          | date
Turlock Express   | 2014-11-14

Question: who did the team play after the las vegas legends on november 10?
Answer: Let's think step by step.  
The next opponent listed after November 10 is Turlock Express.  
Final Answer: Turlock Express

Table_title: World War II casualties of Poland
SQL: SELECT "row_number", "Total" FROM T WHERE "Total" < 350000;

SQL Execution Result:
row_number | Total
4 | 100000
5 | 2000

Question: what is the only years that total losses were below 350,000?
A: To find the answer to this question, let’s think step by step.
Prediction: 1944/45
[Gold Answer] 1944/45

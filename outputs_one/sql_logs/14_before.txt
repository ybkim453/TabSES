Generated Reasoning SQL: The summary indicates that the "1939/40" column is numeric and represents the number of deaths in a specific year. To find the total deaths in 1939/40, we sum the values in this column. Since the column contains numeric values, we can directly sum them without any additional casting.
SQL: select sum("1939/40") from T;

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- If one cell is returned, use it directly.
- If multiple rows/columns, reason step by step over the SQL result to select, count, or summarize per the question.
- Never apologize; the SQL result always has the answer.
- Return values exactly as in the result, unless a transformation (count, difference, etc.) is explicitly asked.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

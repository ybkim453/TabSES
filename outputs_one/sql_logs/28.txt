   - Role: Descriptor for the division number

3. League:
   - Data type: Categorical
   - 4 representative example values: ASL
   - Role: Descriptor for the league name

4. Reg. Season:
   - Data type: Categorical
   - 4 representative example values: ?, 6th
   - Role: Measure for the regular season performance

5. Playoffs:
   - Data type: Categorical

**Outlier Row Analysis:**

1. Row 23:
   - The values in this row are missing for all columns, making it an outlier due to the lack of data.

2. Row 3:
   - The Reg. Season value is "6th", which is consistent with other entries in the table. This row is an ordinary row and does not require special handling.

3. Row 0:
   - The National Cup value is "Final", which is different from the majority of the table where the National Cup values are missing or ambiguous. This makes the row an outlier.

Overall, Row 23 is an outlier due to missing data, Row 3 is an ordinary row, and Row 0 is an outlier due to a distinctive value in the National Cup column.

Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To find the years where championships were held without playoffs, we need to look for rows where the "National Cup" column indicates a championship win without playoffs. We should exclude the outlier row 0 where the National Cup value is "Final" as it is not a championship win without playoffs. The row 3 with Reg. Season value "?" should also be excluded as it does not provide relevant information for this question.

SQL: 
SELECT "Year"
FROM T
WHERE "National Cup" = 'Champion (no playoff)' AND "Year" <> '1935/36';
Generated Final SQL: SELECT "Year" FROM T WHERE "National Cup" = 'Champion (no playoff)' AND "Year" <> '1935/36';

Always start by carefully examining the summary to identify which columns, data types, and special cases are relevant to the question.  
Then, use the full table to confirm and extract the exact values based on the hints from the summary.  
Your reasoning must explicitly combine evidence from both the summary and the full table before giving the final answer.

How many cyclists in the top 10 were French?
To answer this question, I will use both the summary and the full table.

From the summary:
- The **Cyclist** column is text and includes both name and nationality in parentheses, e.g., "Stéphane Goubert (FRA)".
- Special / Atypical Rows: none were listed, so every row in the preview represents an individual cyclist.
- Preprocessing Artifacts: none critical except "s.t." in the Time column, which stands for "same time". This does not affect nationality counting.

From the full table:
- The cyclists with "(FRA)" are:
  1. Stéphane Goubert (Rank 8, FRA)
  2. David Moncoutié (Rank 10, FRA)

Thus, by combining the summary’s description (Cyclist column contains nationality; no atypical rows interfere)  
with the explicit entries in the full table, we can conclude there are 2 French cyclists in the top 10.

Final Answer: Stéphane Goubert, David Moncoutié

Question: in what other year other than 1935/36 were championships held without playoffs?
A: To find the answer to this question, let’s think step by step.
[Fallback] Raw Response: To answer this question, we need to focus on the "National Cup" column in the table. Specifically, we are looking for years where the team was declared a champion without having playoffs. 

From the table:
- In addition to 1935/36, championships were held without playoffs in the following years:
  2. 1953/54

Therefore, the years other than 1935/36 where championships were held without playoffs are 1944/45 and 1953/54.

Final Answer: 1953/54
[Fallback] Prediction: 1953/54
[Gold Answer] 1953/54

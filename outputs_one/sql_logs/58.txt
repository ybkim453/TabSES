Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: The summary indicates that the "Date" column is categorical and can be used to filter rows based on the year. To answer the question, we need to count the number of competitions that occurred before the year 2009. We will filter the rows where the "Date" is less than '2009-01-01'. The summary does not specify any outlier rows that need to be excluded for this count, so we will include all relevant rows. 

SQL: 
Select count("Competition") from T where "Date" < '2009-01-01';
Generated Final SQL: Select count("Competition") from T where "Date" < '2009-01-01';
SQL 실행 결과 셀 수: 1

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- Always write a short reasoning step before the Final Answer.
- If one cell is returned: briefly confirm it is the only result.
- If multiple rows/columns: reason step by step to filter or choose.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

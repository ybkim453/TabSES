**Outlier Row Analysis:**

1. Row 5 (Lightship No. 82)
   - The value "Point Albino (near Buffalo)" in the Location column is different from the other locations mentioned in the table, which are near specific towns or cities. This makes the row an outlier.

2. Row 11
   - The value "nan" in the Location column is not a specific location like the other entries. This could indicate missing data, making this row an outlier.

3. Row 7 (Regina)
   - The value "nan" in the Lives lost column indicates missing data, which is different from the other entries that have a specific number of lives lost. This makes the row an outlier.

Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To determine the last type of vessel listed in the table, we need to focus on the "Type of Vessel" column, which is categorical and contains different types of vessels such as Barge, Steamer, and Lightship. We should consider all rows in the table, including outliers, as the question does not specify excluding any specific rows based on the outlier analysis.

SQL: 
SELECT "Type of Vessel"
FROM T
ORDER BY row_number DESC
LIMIT 1;
Generated Final SQL: SELECT "Type of Vessel" FROM T ORDER BY row_number DESC LIMIT 1;

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- Always write a short reasoning step before the Final Answer.
- If one cell is returned: briefly confirm it is the only result.
- If multiple rows/columns: reason step by step to filter or choose.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

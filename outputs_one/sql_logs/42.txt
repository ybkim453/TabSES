How many cyclists in the top 10 were French?
To answer this question, I will use both the summary and the full table.

From the summary:
- The **Cyclist** column is text and includes both name and nationality in parentheses, e.g., "Stéphane Goubert (FRA)".
- Special / Atypical Rows: none were listed, so every row in the preview represents an individual cyclist.
- Preprocessing Artifacts: none critical except "s.t." in the Time column, which stands for "same time". This does not affect nationality counting.

From the full table:
- The cyclists with "(FRA)" are:
  1. Stéphane Goubert (Rank 8, FRA)
  2. David Moncoutié (Rank 10, FRA)

Thus, by combining the summary’s description (Cyclist column contains nationality; no atypical rows interfere)  
with the explicit entries in the full table, we can conclude there are 2 French cyclists in the top 10.

Final Answer: Stéphane Goubert, David Moncoutié

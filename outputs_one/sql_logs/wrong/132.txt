Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To determine how many times the Cowboys won the NFC Championship in the 1970s, we need to filter the rows where the Team is "Dallas Cowboys" and the Season is between 1970 and 1979. The "Runner Up" column indicates the runner-up team in each season, so we can count the rows where the Cowboys were the winning team.

SQL: 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS nfc_championship_wins
FROM T
WHERE "Team" = 'Dallas Cowboys' 
AND "Season" BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979;
Generated Final SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS nfc_championship_wins FROM T WHERE "Team" = 'Dallas Cowboys' AND "Season" BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979;

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- Always write a short reasoning step before the Final Answer.
- If one cell is returned: briefly confirm it is the only result.
- If multiple rows/columns: reason step by step to filter or choose.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

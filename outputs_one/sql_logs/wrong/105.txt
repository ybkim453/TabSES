Generated Reasoning SQL: To determine the total number of years that Errea manufactured kits for Cheltenham Town F.C., we need to count the distinct years where the Kit Manufacturer is Errea.

Explanation: The relevant column for this question is "Year" as it represents the years in which kits were manufactured by different companies. The "Kit Manufacturer" column is categorical and contains the manufacturer names. We are interested in counting the total years where Errea was the manufacturer.

SQL: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "Year") AS total_years_errea_manufactured
FROM T
WHERE "Kit Manufacturer" = 'Errea';
Generated Final SQL: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "Year") AS total_years_errea_manufactured FROM T WHERE "Kit Manufacturer" = 'Errea';

Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To determine the years in which Marek Plawgo had the most competitions, we need to count the number of rows for each unique year and then select the top three years with the highest counts. Since we are interested in the count of competitions, we will use the "Year" column to group the data and count the rows for each year.

SQL: 
SELECT "Year", COUNT(*) AS competition_count
FROM T
GROUP BY "Year"
ORDER BY competition_count DESC
LIMIT 3;
Generated Final SQL: SELECT "Year", COUNT(*) AS competition_count FROM T GROUP BY "Year" ORDER BY competition_count DESC LIMIT 3;
SQL 실행 결과 셀 수: 6

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- Always write a short reasoning step before the Final Answer.
- If one cell is returned: briefly confirm it is the only result.
- If multiple rows/columns: reason step by step to filter or choose.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To determine the number of competitions that Hopley competed in, we need to count the distinct values in the "Competition" column for the athlete "Hannes Hopley". Since the summary does not mention any outlier rows for this question, we can include all rows where the athlete is "Hannes Hopley".

SQL: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "Competition") AS num_competitions
FROM T
WHERE "Athlete" = 'Hannes Hopley';
Generated Final SQL: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "Competition") AS num_competitions FROM T WHERE "Athlete" = 'Hannes Hopley';
SQL 실행 결과 셀 수: 1

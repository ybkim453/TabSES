=== Table Summary ===
**Column Analysis:**

1. **Tournament:**
   - Data type: Categorical
   - 4 representative example values: Miami Masters, Madrid Masters, Shanghai Masters, Paris Masters
   - Role: Identifier for the tournament name

2. **2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014:**
   - Data type: Categorical/Numeric
   - 4 representative example values: A, 2R, 1R, nan
   - Role: Measure of performance for each year in the respective tournament

3. **W-L:**
   - Data type: Categorical/Numeric
   - 4 representative example values: 3-6, 5-5, 4-3, 1-3
   - Role: Measure of win-loss record for each tournament

**Outlier Row Analysis:**

1. **Row 0 (Miami Masters):**
   - The values for 2007 and 2008 are different from the majority of the table (2R and 1R compared to A).
   - These values indicate a significant drop in performance for those years, making this row an outlier.

2. **Row 12 (Hamburg Masters):**
   - The value for 2006 is 2R, which is different from the majority of the table (A).
   - This indicates a slightly better performance in 2006 compared to other years, making this row an outlier.

3. **Row 14 (Outlier Row):**
   - The values for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 are all A, which is consistent with the majority of the table.
   - This row contains missing data (nan) for the 2014 column, which is not a distinctive value and does not make this row an outlier.

Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To determine the grand slam tournament where Guillermo García-López had the least amount of wins, we need to consider the "W-L" column, which represents the win-loss record for each tournament. We should exclude outlier rows that do not represent a specific tournament performance, such as the row for "Win-Loss" totals. We will focus on rows that correspond to individual tournaments and find the minimum number of wins among them.

SQL: 
SELECT "Tournament"
FROM T
WHERE "Tournament" NOT LIKE '%Masters%' -- Exclude non-grand slam tournaments
AND "Tournament" NOT LIKE '%Win-Loss%' -- Exclude total win-loss row
ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTR("W-L", 1, INSTR("W-L", '-') - 1) AS INTEGER) -- Order by wins in ascending order
LIMIT 1; -- Select the tournament with the least wins
Generated Final SQL: SELECT "Tournament" FROM T WHERE "Tournament" NOT LIKE '%Masters%' -- Exclude non-grand slam tournaments AND "Tournament" NOT LIKE '%Win-Loss%' -- Exclude total win-loss row ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTR("W-L", 1, INSTR("W-L", '-') - 1) AS INTEGER) -- Order by wins in ascending order LIMIT 1; -- Select the tournament with the least wins

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- Always write a short reasoning step before the Final Answer.
- If one cell is returned: briefly confirm it is the only result.
- If multiple rows/columns: reason step by step to filter or choose.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

Examples:

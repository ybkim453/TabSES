Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To find a year when Radhika Pandit was in at least two films, we need to group the data by the "Year" column and count the number of films for each year. We then filter the results to only include years where the count of films is greater than or equal to 2.

SQL: 
SELECT "Year"
FROM T
GROUP BY "Year"
HAVING COUNT("Film") >= 2;
Generated Final SQL: SELECT "Year" FROM T GROUP BY "Year" HAVING COUNT("Film") >= 2;
SQL 실행 결과 셀 수: 5

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- Always write a short reasoning step before the Final Answer.
- If one cell is returned: briefly confirm it is the only result.
- If multiple rows/columns: reason step by step to filter or choose.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

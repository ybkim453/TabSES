Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To find the year with the most deaths outside of prisons & camps, we need to compare the values in the columns "1939/40", "1940/41", "1941/42", "1942/43", "1943/44", and "1944/45" for the category "Deaths Outside of Prisons & Camps". We will need to exclude the outlier row representing the total.
We will identify the year with the highest number of deaths outside of prisons & camps by summing the values in these columns for each row and selecting the maximum value.

SQL: 
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN "1939/40" > "1940/41" AND "1939/40" > "1941/42" AND "1939/40" > "1942/43" AND "1939/40" > "1943/44" AND "1939/40" > "1944/45" THEN '1939/40'
        WHEN "1940/41" > "1939/40" AND "1940/41" > "1941/42" AND "1940/41" > "1942/43" AND "1940/41" > "1943/44" AND "1940/41" > "1944/45" THEN '1940/41'

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- If one cell is returned, use it directly.
- If multiple rows/columns, reason step by step over the SQL result to select, count, or summarize per the question.
- Never apologize; the SQL result always has the answer.
- Return values exactly as in the result, unless a transformation (count, difference, etc.) is explicitly asked.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

Examples:

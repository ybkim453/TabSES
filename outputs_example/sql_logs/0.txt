**Outlier Row Analysis:**

1. Row 0:
   - The time value is 5h 29' 10", which is significantly higher than the other time values in the table.
   - This row is an outlier due to the unusually high time value compared to the rest of the data.

2. Row 9:
   - The time value is + 2", which is different from the "s.t." values in the other rows.
   - This row is an outlier due to the unique time format compared to the majority of the table.

3. Row 1:
   - The cyclist is Alexandr Kolobnev (RUS), which is different from the other cyclists in the table.
   - This row is an outlier due to the distinct cyclist nationality compared to the rest of the data.

Generated Reasoning SQL: Explanation: To determine the country with the most cyclists finishing within the top 10, we need to count the number of cyclists from each country in the top 10 ranks. The "Cyclist" column contains both the cyclist's name and nationality in parentheses. We will extract the country from this column and count the occurrences for each country within the top 10 ranks.

SQL: 
SELECT 
    SUBSTR("Cyclist", INSTR("Cyclist", '(') + 1, 3) AS country_code,
    COUNT(*) AS cyclist_count
FROM T
WHERE "Rank" <= 10
GROUP BY country_code
ORDER BY cyclist_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
Generated Final SQL: SELECT SUBSTR("Cyclist", INSTR("Cyclist", '(') + 1, 3) AS country_code, COUNT(*) AS cyclist_count FROM T WHERE "Rank" <= 10 GROUP BY country_code ORDER BY cyclist_count DESC LIMIT 1;
SQL 실행 결과 셀 수: 2

Reasoning Prompt:

You are a strict SQL reasoning assistant. 
Your task is to return the final answer **directly from the SQL result table**.

Rules:
- Do not generate new SQL or mention schema/summary.
- Always write a short reasoning step before the Final Answer.
- If one cell is returned: briefly confirm it is the only result.
- If multiple rows/columns: reason step by step to filter or choose.
- Ensure the final answer format is only "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2..." form, no other form. And ensure the final answer is a number or entity names, as short as possible, without any explanation.

Examples:

Table_title: Olympic Events
SQL: select "event" from T where cast("year" as integer) = 2008
